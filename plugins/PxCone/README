Dear Gavin,
As an author of the PxCone code, and having checked that this is 
acceptable with the other authors of PxCone (Luis Del Pozo and his then 
PhD supervisor David Ward), I hereby grant you the right to distribute 
PxCone together with FastJet under a GPL (v2) license.
Many thanks for dealing with this,
Mike.
