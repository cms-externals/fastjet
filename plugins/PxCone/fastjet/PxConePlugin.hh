/// Implementation of the PxCone algorithm (plugin for fastjet v2.1 upwards)
///
/// PxConePlugin is a plugin for fastjet (v2.1 upwards) that provides
/// an interface to the fortran pxcone iterative cone algorithm with
/// midpoint seeds.
///
/// Pxcone was written by Luis del Pozo and Michael H. Seymour. It is
/// not a "supported" program, so if you encounter problems, you are
/// on your own...
///
/// Note that pxcone sometimes encounters non-stable iterations; in
/// such cases it returns an error -- the plugin propagates this by
/// throwing a fastjet::Error exception; if the user wishes to have
/// robust code, they should catch this exception.
///
/// Pxcone has a hard-coded limit (by default 4000) on the maximum
/// number of particles and protojets; if the number of particles or
/// protojets exceeds this, again a fastjet::Error exception will be
/// thrown.
///
/// The functionality of pxcone is described at 
/// http://www.hep.man.ac.uk/u/wplano/ConeJet.ps

  ///   - stables cones (protojets) below min_jet_energy are discarded
  ///     before calling the splitting procedure to resolve overlaps
  ///     (called epslon in pxcone).

  ///       (overlapping_Et)/(Et_of_softer_protojet) < overlap_threshold
  ///     the overlapping energy is split between the two protojets;
  ///     otherwise the less energetic protojet is discarded. Called
  ///     ovlim in pxcone.
  ///
  ///   - pxcone carries out p-scheme recombination, and the resulting 
  ///     jets are massless; setting E_scheme_jets = true (default
