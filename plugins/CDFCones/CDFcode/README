This directory contains code by CDF for jet clustering. It is
essentially as downloaded from Joey Huston's page, EXCEPT that we have


. added functionality in MidPointAlgorithm.cc for using Et or
  transverse mass (instead of pt) as the comparison and ordering
  variable inside the split-merge step. The defaults are the same as
  before.

. added corresponding helpers in ClusterComparisons.hh and
  LorentzVector.hh

added functionality for the "pt_tilde" scale in the split-merge; as
well as modifications in the places indicated above, we've also added
maintenance of the pt_tilde scale in the Cluster.hh class.

added protection in midpoint code for cases when no stable cones are
found (e.g. because all particles are below seed threshold).
