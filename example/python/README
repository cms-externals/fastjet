Examples of FastJet usage with Python
=====================================

The examples here show functionality similar to what is provided by
some of the C++ examples in ../

For them to work, make sure that the installation location for the
fastjet python module is included in your PYTHONPATH environment
variable (e.g. PREFIX/lib/python2.7/site-packages and/or
PREFIX/lib64/python2.7/site-packages -- on some systems both may be
needed).

Some things to keep in mind:

- You can pass a python list such as [PseudoJet0, PseudoJet1, ...]
  to any FastJet call that expects a vector of PseudoJets

- Any FastJet call that in C++ returns a vector of PseudoJets will in python
  return a list of PseudoJets

- For many objects that provide definitions of some kind, the __str__
  call maps to description() (potentially with an extra bit of
  explanatory info)

- For combinations of selectors, (&&, || and !) in C++ map to (&, | and ~) in python

- Any python variable var can be associated with a PseudoJet using the
  PseudoJet.set_python_info(var) call; it can be retried with the
  PseudoJet.python_info() call

- Remember that python uses references, e.g. a = b means that a is a
  reference to b. If you need to copy a PseudoJet (pj), with a view to
  altering it, do "pjcopy = PseudoJet(pj)"
