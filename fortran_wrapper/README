README file for fastjet-X.Y.Z/fortran_wrapper
---------------------------------------------

This directory provides basic wrappers to fastjet's main pp sequential
recombination algorithms and to SISCone so as to be able to access them
from Fortran (or any other prehistoric language).

fastjetfortran.cc
        the file that does the wrapping

fastjet_fortran_example.f
        an example showing how to use it from a fortran main
        (look at the first few lines for compilation and usage)

Makefile.alt
        for building (outside of the autotools framework)

If you have installed fastjet (and it is in your path), then do

> make -f Makefile.alt
> ./fastjet_fortran_example < ../example/data/single-event.dat

These wrappers are usually updated on request. If you need features
that are not available, contact the authors for help.
