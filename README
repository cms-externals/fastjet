FastJet
-------

The FastJet package, written by Matteo Cacciari and Gavin Salam and
Gregory Soyez, provides a fast implementation of several
longitudinally invariant sequential recombination jet algorithms, in
particular the longitudinally invariant kt jet algorithm, the
inclusive longitudinally invariant version of the Cambridge/Aachen
jet-algorithm, and the inclusive anti-kt algorithm.

The implementation is based on the geometrical methods described in
M. Cacciari and G.P. Salam, Phys. Lett. B 641 (2006) 57
[hep-ph/0512210]. The full FastJet manual is available as
doc/fastjet-doc.tex and also as arXiv:1111.6097.

Means are also provided for accessing external jet-algorithm software
via a common (plugin) interface and the package notably includes
SISCone, an infrared safe seedless stable-cone type algorithm introduced
in G.P. Salam and G. Soyez, JHEP 0705 (2007) 086 [arXiv:0704.0292].

Various tools are also provided related to jet areas and
subtraction. They can be used with any infrared safe jet algorithm,
both native and plugin. The ideas behind them are described in
M. Cacciari, G.P. Salam, Phys.Lett.B 659 (2008) 119 [arXiv:0707.1378], and
M. Cacciari, G.P. Salam and G. Soyez, JHEP 0804 (2008) 005 [arXiv:0802.1188]

Tools are also provided to facilitate jet substructure analyses.

Installation
------------
Installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.

Note that to benefit from NlnN implementation (relevant for a number
of particles N greater than 15000 roughly) of the kt (and anti-kt) jet
algorithm , you will need to download CGAL from http://www.cgal.org/
and compile it before compiling the FastJet library. The NlnN
implementation of the Cambridge/Aachen jet-algorithm is independent of
CGAL.

Automatic documentation can be generated by running the doxygen command 
(if not installed on your system see www.doxygen.org) in the main 
directory. It will create the html/ and latex/ directories containing 
detailed documentation of all classes etc.. More standard
documentation is to be found in the doc/ directory.
